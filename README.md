I'm a Junior Java Developer 

I have experience in developing microservices using Java with Spring Boot and Quarkus, code maintenance, code versioning with git, building and testing APIs, containers, AWS Cloud, continuous integration, unit testing with JUnit and Mockito in Java and Kotlin, integration testing in Java and code analysis.
